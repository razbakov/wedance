        <p class="text-foreground mb-4">
          The roots of Salsa Cubana can be traced back to the late 1950s in the
          dance halls (casinos deportivos) of Cuba. It evolved from various
          Cuban dance forms, including Son, Mambo, and Rumba, incorporating
          elements of these traditional styles into a dynamic and social dance
          form.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground">
          The dance gained popularity first in Cuba and then spread
          internationally, becoming one of the most beloved Latin dance styles
          worldwide.
