# Logo Decision

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Alex Razbakov, Anja, Aina

## Context

The current WeDance logo was created collaboratively by the core team members. A discussion arose about potentially changing the logo.

## Decision

We decided to keep the current logo unchanged because:

1. It is used on all our marketing materials (20+ instagram accounts, 100+ telegram groups, videos, flyers, etc.)
2. Changing the logo would be too expensive
3. The current logo has established brand recognition

## Consequences

### Positive

- Maintains brand consistency
- No additional design costs
- Preserves the collaborative work of the core team
- Keeps recognition across all platforms

### Negative

- Any potential improvements or modernization are postponed
- We need to change the color scheme of the website to match the logo
