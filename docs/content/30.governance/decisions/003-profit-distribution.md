# Decision Record: Profit Distribution Policy

## Context

To ensure fair compensation for contributors' time and effort, we need a clear policy for how contributions are valued and how profits are distributed. WeDance has a rich history of contributions dating back to March 2017, starting with kizomba.news and evolving through multiple iterations including DanceCard, WeDance v1, and WeDance v2.

## Decision

We will implement the following profit distribution policy:

### Initial Share Distribution

1. Founder Share: 50% (recognition of historical contributions and founding)
2. Community Pool: 50% (distributed based on contributions)

### Time Valuation

1. Contributor time will be recognized as monetary investment
2. Hourly rate calculation:
   - Based on contributor's current job rate
   - Based on potential job rate (if provable)
   - Default rate of 15 EUR/hour for those without work experience
3. Active founders can earn additional shares from the community pool through ongoing contributions

### Historical Contributions

1. Historical contributions from March 2017 to present will be recognized and valued
2. Key milestones include:
   - Kizomba News (Mar 2017 - Oct 2018)
   - DanceCard (Oct 2018 - Dec 2019)
   - WeDance v1 (May 2020)
   - WeDance v2 (Sep 2020)
   - Ambassador Program (Jul 2021)
   - Local Committee (Nov 2021)
   - Design Sprints (Mar 2023)
3. Historical contributors should document their contributions with:
   - Time period
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Estimated hours
   - Supporting evidence (commits, documents, testimonials)

### Additional Benefits

1. WeDance will provide Cursor IDE license for all active contributors

### Implementation

1. Contributors must track their time contributions
2. Proof of current/potential job rate must be provided if claiming higher than default rate
3. Time contributions will be converted to investment shares based on the applicable hourly rate
4. Share calculation:
   - Founder's base share: 50% (fixed)
   - Community pool: 50% distributed based on investment value
   - Investment value = Hours contributed × Hourly rate
   - Share from community pool = (Individual investment value / Total community investment value) × 50%
5. Total individual share = Base share (if founder) + Share from community pool
6. Historical contributions will be reviewed and validated by the core team
7. Shares and distributions will be recalculated quarterly based on new contributions
