# Decision Record: Historical Contributions Recognition

## Context

WeDance has evolved from a simple newsletter (Kizomba News) in 2017 to a comprehensive dance platform through multiple iterations. Many contributors have invested significant time and effort throughout this journey. We need to formally recognize these historical contributions and establish a framework for valuing them.

As of WeDance v3.14.0, the platform has achieved significant global reach:

- 231 cities across 60 countries
- 3,119 registered members
- 5,743 events organized
- 4,000 monthly active users (March 2024)
- 1.5K monthly clicks from Google Search (February 2024)

Our Munich community Instagram presence (@wedancemunich) shows strong social engagement:

- 2,133 posts
- 5,099 followers
- 6,944 following
  (as of January 2025)
